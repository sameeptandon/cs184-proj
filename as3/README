Platform:
We developed our code on Ubuntu Linux 11.04 x64 and Mac OS X Lion. We've tested that it compiles and runs on cory.eecs (Solaris)
Optional features:
Toon shading: -toon <intervals> (# of intervals for toon shading to use, e.g. 10)
Ground: -gnd (this shades the ground)
Multiple spheres that shadow each other: -ms (please don't use with other options, including lighting)
Hitting ">": Performs physics simulation (can't resize the window while doing this). This requires Bullet - See README_BULLET
Animation: drag mouse around, this rotates the light sources about the sphere
