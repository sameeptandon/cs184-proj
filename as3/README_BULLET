We implemented physical simulation of many spheres using Bullet Physics. We used BulletPhysics 2.77, available at http://bullet.googlecode.com/files/bullet-2.77.zip. The library can be built on unix using the commands

cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON . -G 'Unix Makefiles'
sudo make install

After installing the library, you need to modify the makefiles to include the library header files and link to the library binaries. This is shown in the mac makefile. 

Finally, you need to enable bullet in shading.cpp by changing "#define BULLET 0" to "#define BULLET 1".  You should be able to compile the file at this point.

To step through the physical simulation, use the '>' key to advance.


We used code from the Bullet Hello World tutorial, available at: 

http://bulletphysics.org/mediawiki-1.5.8/index.php/Hello_World

to make this simulation run.
