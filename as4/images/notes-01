This image shows that our raytracer correctly does intersection tests for spheres. It also shows that we are doing Phong shading correctly, and that our directional lights are working, it also shows that our shadows are working correctly (i.e. intersection tests from the object to the light are working).

Note that the command to generate each image is simply to run ./input-xx. This calls our raytracer with a scene file and the appropriate command line arguments.
